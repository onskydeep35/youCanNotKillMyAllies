    "answer": "Box 2",
    "reasoning": [
      "Identify the three statements: Statement 1 (Box 1): 'The car is in this box.', Statement 2 (Box 2): 'The car is not in this box.', Statement 3 (Box 3): 'The car is not in box 1.'",
      "Identify the constraint: Exactly one of the statements is true, and only one box contains the car.",
      "Evaluate Case 1: The car is in Box 1. In this case, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is also true because the car is in Box 1 and therefore not in Box 2. Statement 3 is false because the car is in Box 1. This results in two true statements (S1 and S2), which violates the constraint.",
      "Evaluate Case 2: The car is in Box 2. In this case, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is false because the car is in Box 2, making the statement 'The car is not in this box' incorrect. Statement 3 is true because the car is indeed not in Box 1. This results in exactly one true statement (S3), which satisfies the constraint.",
      "Evaluate Case 3: The car is in Box 3. In this case, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because the car is in Box 3 and therefore not in Box 2. Statement 3 is true because the car is indeed not in Box 1. This results in two true statements (S2 and S3), which violates the constraint.",
      "Conclusion: Case 2 is the only scenario where exactly one statement is true. Therefore, the car must be in Box 2."
