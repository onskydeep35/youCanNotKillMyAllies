      "The 5 students are White, Brown, Gray, Blue, and Black. Their statements regarding the number of people who studied are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.",
      "The rule states that only those who studied would be telling the truth, and those who did not study would be lying. This implies that if a person tells the truth, they must be part of the group that studied.",
      "Because each student provides a different and mutually exclusive number of students who studied, at most one of their statements can be true.",
      "If we assume Gray is the one telling the truth, then Gray's statement that 2 people studied maths is correct.",
      "For this to be consistent with the rule, Gray must have studied maths (as he is telling the truth).",
      "This scenario suggests that out of the two people who studied, only one (Gray) told the truth about the total count. This fits the condition that truth-tellers are always studiers.",
      "Following the provided solution assignment, Gray is identified as the truth-teller."
