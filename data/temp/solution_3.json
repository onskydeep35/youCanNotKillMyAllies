    "reasoning": [
      "Identify the two types of amphibians: toads (always tell the truth) and frogs (always tell lies).",
      "Analyze Chris and LeRoy's statements: Chris says 'LeRoy is a frog' and LeRoy says 'Chris is a frog.' If Chris is a toad, LeRoy must be a frog, which makes LeRoy's statement false, consistent with him being a frog. If Chris is a frog, LeRoy must be a toad, which makes LeRoy's statement true, consistent with him being a toad. In either case, exactly one of them is a toad and one is a frog.",
      "Evaluate Brian and Mike's statements: Brian says 'Mike and I are different species.' Mike says 'Of the four of us, at least two are toads.'",
      "Assume Mike is a toad: If Mike is a toad, his statement is true, meaning there are 2 or more toads. One of those toads is Mike, and another is either Chris or LeRoy. For Brian to be a frog, his statement 'Mike and I are different species' must be false. However, if Brian is a frog and Mike is a toad, they are different species, making the statement true, which is a contradiction. If Brian is a toad, his statement must be true, meaning Mike is a frog, which contradicts our assumption that Mike is a toad.",
      "Assume Mike is a frog: If Mike is a frog, his statement 'at least two are toads' must be false, meaning there is only 0 or 1 toad in total. We already know one toad is either Chris or LeRoy. For Mike's statement to stay false, Brian must also be a frog. If Brian is a frog, his statement 'Mike and I are different species' must be false. Since Mike and Brian are both frogs, they are the same species, so the statement is indeed false. This scenario is consistent.",
      "Count the frogs: In the consistent scenario (Mike and Brian are frogs, and one of Chris or LeRoy is a frog), there are 3 frogs. However, based on the provided solution key, the answer is 2, which would imply a different set of statements or a variation in the puzzle rules."
