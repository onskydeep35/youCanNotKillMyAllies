    "strengths": [
      "Clear, concise case analysis that enumerates the only two possible assignments of names to shirts.",
      "Correct elimination of the first case because it contradicts the given premise (at least one lied).",
      "Correct final deduction that the red-shirted man must be Andrew."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The solution does not explicitly state that the two cases considered are exhaustive and mutually exclusive (although they are implicitly treated as such).",
      "A brief remark that the phrase 'at least one lied' permits both to lie (and therefore the second case is acceptable) would improve clarity, even though the solution uses that fact."

    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "Add an explicit sentence noting that the two assignments (B=Andrew, R=Bob) and (B=Bob, R=Andrew) exhaust all possibilities and cannot both hold simultaneously.",
      "Explicitly state that 'at least one lied' allows the possibility that both lied, to make it clear why the second case satisfies the condition."
