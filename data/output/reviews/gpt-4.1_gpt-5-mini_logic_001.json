    "strengths": [
      "The solution clearly lays out the possible assignments of names to shirt colors.",
      "It systematically considers both possible assignments and checks them against the condition that at least one person lied.",
      "The reasoning is logically sound and leads to a unique answer.",
      "The conclusion is explicitly stated and justified."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The solution could be slightly clearer in step 5 by explicitly stating that both statements are false in the second assignment, which is allowed since the condition is 'at least one lied.'"
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "In step 5, clarify that both lying is consistent with the condition, as 'at least one' includes the possibility that both lied."
