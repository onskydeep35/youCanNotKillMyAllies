    "strengths": [
      "Correctly enumerates the only two possible assignments of names to shirt colors.",
      "Accurately evaluates the truth value of each spoken statement under each assignment.",
      "Logically eliminates the assignment that contradicts the given condition and selects the consistent one."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No substantive weaknesses affecting correctness; the solution is concise and could add a single clarifying sentence about why 'both lied' satisfies 'at least one lied' (though this is already implied)."
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "Add an explicit sentence clarifying that 'at least one lied' permits both to lie, which is why Case 2 is acceptable — this makes the justification slightly more explicit for readers unfamiliar with the phrasing.",
      "Optionally state upfront the implicit assumption that names are distinct and each man has exactly one of the two names (Andrew or Bob) to make assumptions explicit."
