    "Let T = toad (always tells the truth), F = frog (always lies). Assign variables: B = Brian, C = Chris, L = LeRoy, M = Mike.",
    "Brian says: 'Mike and I are different species.' If Brian is T, then Mike is F, or vice versa. If Brian is F, then they are the same species.",
    "Chris says: 'LeRoy is a frog.' If Chris is T, LeRoy is F. If Chris is F, LeRoy is T.",
    "LeRoy says: 'Chris is a frog.' If LeRoy is T, Chris is F. If LeRoy is F, Chris is T.",
    "Mike says: 'Of the four of us, at least two are toads.' If Mike is T, this is true. If Mike is F, then fewer than two are toads (i.e., at most one toad).",
    "Let’s try possible assignments. Assume Brian is T (toad):",
    "Then Mike is F (frog), by Brian's statement. So B=T, M=F.",
    "Mike is a frog, so his statement is false: 'At least two are toads' is false, so at most one is a toad. But Brian is already a toad, so the rest (Chris, LeRoy) must be frogs. So C=F, L=F.",
    "Check Chris's statement: Chris is a frog, so his statement is false. He says 'LeRoy is a frog', but LeRoy is a frog, so the statement is true, which contradicts Chris being a frog (should be false).",
    "So Brian cannot be a toad. Try Brian is a frog (F):",
    "Then his statement is false: 'Mike and I are different species' is false, so they are the same species. So Mike is also a frog (M=F).",
    "Now, Mike is a frog, so his statement is false: 'At least two are toads' is false, so at most one is a toad. So among Brian, Chris, LeRoy, Mike, at most one is a toad. Brian and Mike are frogs, so at most one of Chris or LeRoy is a toad.",
    "Now, Chris says: 'LeRoy is a frog.' If Chris is T, LeRoy is F. If Chris is F, LeRoy is T.",
    "LeRoy says: 'Chris is a frog.' If LeRoy is T, Chris is F. If LeRoy is F, Chris is T.",
    "Try Chris is T (toad), LeRoy is F (frog):",
    "Chris is T, so LeRoy is F. LeRoy is F, so his statement is false: 'Chris is a frog' is false, so Chris is a toad. Consistent.",
    "Now, total toads: Chris only. Brian, Mike, LeRoy are frogs. Only one toad, which fits with Mike's false statement (at most one toad).",
    "Check all statements:",
    "Brian (F): 'Mike and I are different species.' Both are frogs, so statement is false (correct for a frog).",
    "Chris (T): 'LeRoy is a frog.' LeRoy is a frog, so statement is true (correct for a toad).",
    "LeRoy (F): 'Chris is a frog.' Chris is a toad, so statement is false (correct for a frog).",
    "Mike (F): 'At least two are toads.' Only one toad, so statement is false (correct for a frog).",
    "All statements are consistent. So, there are 3 frogs (Brian, LeRoy, Mike) and 1 toad (Chris).",
    "But Mike's statement is 'at least two are toads' and he is a frog, so it must be false: at most one toad. This is satisfied.",
    "So, the answer is 3 frogs. But let's check the other possibility for Chris and LeRoy: Chris is F, LeRoy is T.",
    "Chris is F, so his statement is false: 'LeRoy is a frog' is false, so LeRoy is a toad. LeRoy is T, so his statement is true: 'Chris is a frog' is true, so Chris is a frog. Consistent.",
    "Now, toads: LeRoy only. Brian, Chris, Mike are frogs. Again, only one toad, three frogs. This is the same as before.",
    "Therefore, the only consistent solution is that there are 3 frogs and 1 toad."
