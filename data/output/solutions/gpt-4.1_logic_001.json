    "Let B = man in blue shirt, R = man in red shirt.",
    "Let us assign names: either B is Andrew and R is Bob, or B is Bob and R is Andrew.",
    "B says: 'I am Andrew.' R says: 'I am Bob.'",
    "Case 1: B is Andrew, R is Bob.",
    "Then B says 'I am Andrew' (truth), R says 'I am Bob' (truth). Both tell the truth. But the problem says at least one lied. So this case is impossible.",
    "Case 2: B is Bob, R is Andrew.",
    "Then B says 'I am Andrew' (lie), R says 'I am Bob' (lie). Both are lying. This satisfies the condition that at least one lied.",
    "Therefore, the only possible assignment is: B is Bob, R is Andrew.",
    "Thus, Andrew is wearing the red shirt."
