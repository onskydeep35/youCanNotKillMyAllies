    "Let T represent a Toad (truth-teller) and F represent a Frog (liar).",
    "Analyze Brian's statement: 'Mike and I are different species.' This translates to B <=> (B != M).",
    "If Brian is a Toad (True), then 'Mike and I are different' is True, meaning Mike is a Frog. If Brian is a Frog (False), then 'Mike and I are different' is False, meaning Brian and Mike are the same species (Frogs). In both cases, Mike must be a Frog.",
    "Analyze Mike's statement: 'Of the four of us, at least two are toads.' Since Mike is a Frog, this statement is False.",
    "The negation of 'at least two are toads' is 'fewer than two are toads'. Therefore, there are either 0 or 1 Toads in the group.",
    "Analyze Chris's statement: 'LeRoy is a frog.' This translates to C <=> (L == F). If Chris is a Toad, LeRoy is a Frog. If Chris is a Frog, LeRoy is a Toad. This implies Chris and LeRoy are different species.",
    "Analyze LeRoy's statement: 'Chris is a frog.' This translates to L <=> (C == F). This is logically equivalent to Chris's statement, confirming that exactly one of Chris or LeRoy is a Toad and the other is a Frog.",
    "Since exactly one of Chris and LeRoy is a Toad, the total number of Toads is at least 1.",
    "Combining the deduction from Mike's statement (0 or 1 Toad) and the pair of Chris/LeRoy (exactly 1 Toad), the total number of Toads must be exactly 1.",
    "Since there is exactly 1 Toad and it is either Chris or LeRoy, Brian must be a Frog (consistent with Mike being a Frog).",
    "The species distribution is: Mike (Frog), Brian (Frog), and exactly one of Chris/LeRoy is a Frog while the other is a Toad.",
    "Counting the Frogs: Mike + Brian + (Chris or LeRoy) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 Frogs."
