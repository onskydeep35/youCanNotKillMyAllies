    "Identify the rules: Toads always tell the truth, and frogs always tell lies.",
    "Analyze the statements of Chris and LeRoy: Chris says 'LeRoy is a frog' and LeRoy says 'Chris is a frog'. If Chris is a toad, his statement is true, meaning LeRoy is a frog. If Chris is a frog, his statement is false, meaning LeRoy is a toad. In either case, exactly one of them is a toad and the other is a frog.",
    "Analyze Mike's status: Mike says 'Of the four of us, at least two are toads.' Let's test if Mike is a toad. If Mike is a toad, his statement must be true (at least two toads). We already know one of Chris/LeRoy is a toad, so Mike being a toad would make two toads. Now look at Brian's statement: 'Mike and I are different species.' If Mike is a toad and Brian is a toad, Brian's statement is false, which is impossible for a toad. If Mike is a toad and Brian is a frog, Brian's statement ('Toad and Frog are different') is true, which is impossible for a frog. Thus, Mike cannot be a toad.",
    "Determine Mike and Brian's species: Since Mike must be a frog, his statement 'at least two are toads' must be false. This means there are fewer than two toads (0 or 1). We already know exactly one of Chris or LeRoy is a toad. For the total number of toads to be fewer than two, Brian must also be a frog.",
    "Verify Brian's statement: Brian (a frog) says 'Mike (a frog) and I are different species.' This statement is false because they are the same species. A frog making a false statement is consistent.",
    "Calculate the total number of frogs: Brian is a frog, Mike is a frog, and exactly one of Chris or LeRoy is a frog. 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 frogs."
